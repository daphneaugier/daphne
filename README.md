# Daphne Augier
 
 Welcome to my personal website www.daphneaugier.com!

## Backgroung 

I developed this website with the knowledge I acquired in my classes over my 1st, 2nd and 3rd year in Software Engineering. Particularly in this class called System Process where I got familiar with Angular 7 and MySQLWorkbench as we developed a Twitter-like website. 

## Technologies used

Angular version 7 for the front-end
phpMailer for the /contact component in the back-end

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
